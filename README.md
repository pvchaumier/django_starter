# Bootstrap django project

This little repo is here to help me getting started with a new django project.
I put here all the steps needed to be up and running with the organization of the files I like.

replace django\_application by your application name and django\_starter by the name of your project.

## To install first

### Python
* [python](http://python.org/)
* [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew) to manage python environments and versions
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Database
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Other elements
* [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)


## To use in practise

- [ ] replace django\_application by your application name at every occurence (even names of folders)
- [ ] replace django\_starter by the name of your project
- [ ] replace in conf/settings/prod.py the ALLOWED_HOSTS 
- [ ] replace names in brackets in conf/settings/dev.py
